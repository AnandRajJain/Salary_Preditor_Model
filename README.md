# Salary_Preditor_Model



In this Model what I have done is, I try to created a model that is able to predict the salary of employees for an organisation by analysing the Previous Salary Datasets of that Organisation.


Below Given Are some of the Screen Shots of the Container Environment I have setup : 

1) First I have Launched a container and in that Container I have installed Python3 Plugin with some of its Libraries like Pandas and Numpy etc and also i have installed Github Plugins so that help me to fetch my code from my github Repository.

2) In this Step I have fetch my Repository from Github and store it in some file and try to run it in the container by python commands.
